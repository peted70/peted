<p>With the recent announcements at GDC2015 from Unity about their new licensing model I thought I would update my Kinect and Unity3d post as now a pro Unity license is no longer a requirement. I installed Unity 5 and chose the ‘Personal Edition’ license – more details here <a title="http://unity3d.com/get-unity" href="http://unity3d.com/get-unity">http://unity3d.com/get-unity</a> – this is a free download in which all features of the engine are available.</p> <p><a href="http://peted.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/unity5.png"><img title="unity5" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="unity5" src="http://peted.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/unity5_thumb.png" width="737" height="474"></a> </p> <p>I ran through the steps from my previous <a href="http://peted.azurewebsites.net/kinect-4-windows-v2-unity-3d/" target="_blank">post</a> and everything just worked!</p> <p><a href="http://peted.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/particles.png"><img title="particles" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="particles" src="http://peted.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/particles_thumb.png" width="737" height="416"></a> </p> <p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <blockquote> <p>When Building the Unity project for Windows Store there currently seems to be a problem in Unity 5 where it attempts to copy multiple versions of a plugin and presents you with the error ‘multiple plugins collide’. I worked around this by deleting items from the Plugins folder until only the one I wanted remained.</p></blockquote>
